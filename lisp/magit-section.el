;;; Commentary:

;; This library implements "sections" as used in all Magit buffers.
;; If you have used Magit before then you probably know what that
;; means, otherwise think "read-only Org-Mode for Git", kinda.

TYPE is the section type, a symbol.  Many commands that act on
the current section behave differently depending on that type.
Also if a variable `magit-TYPE-section-map' exists, then use
that as the text-property `keymap' of all text belonging to the
section (but this may be overwritten in subsections).

Optional VALUE is the value of the section, usually a string
that is required when acting on the section.

When optional HIDE is non-nil collapse the section body by
default, i.e. when first creating the section, but not when
refreshing the buffer.  Else expand it by default.  This can be
overwritten using `magit-section-set-visibility-hook'.  When a
section is recreated during a refresh, then the visibility of
predecessor is inherited and HIDE is ignored (but the hook is
still honored).

BODY is any number of forms that actually insert the section's
heading and body.  Optional NAME, if specified, has to be a
symbol, which is then bound to the struct of the section being
inserted.

Before BODY is evaluated the `start' of the section object is set
to the value of `point' and after BODY was evaluated its `end' is
set to the new value of `point'; BODY is responsible for moving
`point' forward.

If it turns out inside BODY that the section is empty, then
`magit-cancel-section' can be used to abort and remove all traces
of the partially inserted section.  This can happen when creating
a section by washing Git's output and Git didn't actually output
anything this time around.

the selection is invalid.  When the selection is valid then the
