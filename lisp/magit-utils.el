;;; Commentary:

;; This library defines several utility functions used by several
;; other libraries which cannot depend on one another (because
;; circular dependencies are not good).  Luckily most (all) of these
;; functions have very little (nothing) to do with Git, so we not only
;; have to do this, it even makes sense.

;; Unfortunately there are also some options which are used by several
;; libraries which cannot depend on one another, they are defined here
;; too.

If you have enabled `ivy-mode' or `helm-mode', then you don't
have to customize this option; `magit-builtin-completing-read'
will work just fine.  However, if you use Ido completion, then
you do have to use `magit-ido-completion-read', because Ido is
less well behaved than the former, more modern alternatives.

If you would like to use Ivy or Helm completion with Magit but
not enable the respective modes globally, then customize this
option to use `ivy-completing-read' or
`helm--completing-read-default'.  If you choose to use
`ivy-completing-read', note that the items may always be shown in
alphabetical order, depending on your version of Ivy."

  "When not to offer alternatives and ask for confirmation.

Many commands by default ask the user to select from a list of
possible candidates.  They do so even when there is a thing at
point that they can act on, which is then offered as the default.

This option can be used to tell certain commands to use the thing
at point instead of asking the user to select a candidate to act
on, with or without confirmation.

The value has the form ((COMMAND nil|PROMPT DEFAULT)...).

- COMMAND is the command that should not prompt for a choice.
  To have an effect, the command has to use the function
  `magit-completing-read' or a utility function which in turn uses
  that function.

- If the command uses `magit-completing-read' multiple times, then
  PROMPT can be used to only affect one of these uses.  PROMPT, if
  non-nil, is a regular expression that is used to match against
  the PROMPT argument passed to `magit-completing-read'.

- DEFAULT specifies how to use the default.  If it is t, then
  the DEFAULT argument passed to `magit-completing-read' is used
  without confirmation.  If it is `ask', then the user is given
  a chance to abort.  DEFAULT can also be nil, in which case the
  entry has no effect."

(defcustom magit-no-confirm nil
  "A list of symbols for actions Magit should not confirm, or t.

Many potentially dangerous commands by default ask the user for
confirmation.  Each of the below symbols stands for an action
which, when invoked unintentionally or without being fully aware
of the consequences, could lead to tears.  In many cases there
are several commands that perform variations of a certain action,
so we don't use the command names but more generic symbols.

Applying changes:

  `discard' Discarding one or more changes (i.e. hunks or the
  complete diff for a file) loses that change, obviously.

  `reverse' Reverting one or more changes can usually be undone
  by reverting the reversion.

  `stage-all-changes', `unstage-all-changes' When there are both
  staged and unstaged changes, then un-/staging everything would
  destroy that distinction.  Of course that also applies when
  un-/staging a single change, but then less is lost and one does
  that so often that having to confirm every time would be
  unacceptable.

Files:

  `delete' When a file that isn't yet tracked by Git is deleted
  then it is completely lost, not just the last changes.  Very
  dangerous.

  `trash' Instead of deleting a file it can also be move to the
  system trash.  Obviously much less dangerous than deleting it.

  Also see option `magit-delete-by-moving-to-trash'.

  `resurrect' A deleted file can easily be resurrected by
  \"deleting\" the deletion, which is done using the same command
  that was used to delete the same file in the first place.

  `untrack' Untracking a file can be undone by tracking it again.

  `rename' Renaming a file can easily be undone.

Sequences:

  `reset-bisect' Aborting (known to Git as \"resetting\") a
  bisect operation loses all information collected so far.

  `abort-rebase' Aborting a rebase throws away all already
  modified commits, but it's possible to restore those from the
  reflog.

  `abort-merge' Aborting a merge throws away all conflict
  resolutions which has already been carried out by the user.

  `merge-dirty' Merging with a dirty worktree can make it hard to
  go back to the state before the merge was initiated.

References:

  `delete-unmerged-branch' Once a branch has been deleted it can
  only be restored using low-level recovery tools provided by
  Git.  And even then the reflog is gone.  The user always has
  to confirm the deletion of a branch by accepting the default
  choice (or selecting another branch), but when a branch has
  not been merged yet, also make sure the user is aware of that.

  `delete-pr-branch' When deleting a branch that was created from
  a pull request and if no other branches still exist on that
  remote, then `magit-branch-delete' offers to delete the remote
  as well.  This should be safe because it only happens if no
  other refs exist in the remotes namespace, and you can recreate
  the remote if necessary.

  `drop-stashes' Dropping a stash is dangerous because Git stores
  stashes in the reflog.  Once a stash is removed, there is no
  going back without using low-level recovery tools provided by
  Git.  When a single stash is dropped, then the user always has
  to confirm by accepting the default (or selecting another).
  This action only concerns the deletion of multiple stashes at
  once.

Edit published history:

  Without adding these symbols here, you will be warned before
  editing commits that have already been pushed to one of the
  branches listed in `magit-published-branches'.

  `amend-published' Affects most commands that amend to \"HEAD\".

  `rebase-published' Affects commands that perform interactive
  rebases.  This includes commands from the commit popup that
  modify a commit other than \"HEAD\", namely the various fixup
  and squash variants.

  `edit-published' Affects the commands `magit-edit-line-commit'
  and `magit-diff-edit-hunk-commit'.  These two commands make
  it quite easy to accidentally edit a published commit, so you
  should think twice before configuring them not to ask for
  confirmation.

  To disable confirmation completely, add all three symbols here
  or set `magit-published-branches' to nil.

Removing modules:

  `remove-modules' When you remove the working directory of a
  module that does not contain uncommitted changes, then that is
  safer than doing so when there are uncommitted changes and/or
  when you also remove the gitdir.  Still, you don't want to do
  that by accident.

  `remove-dirty-modules' When you remove the working directory of
  a module that contains uncommitted changes, then those changes
  are gone for good.  It is better to go to the module, inspect
  these changes and only if appropriate discard them manually.

  `trash-module-gitdirs' When you remove the gitdir of a module,
  then all unpushed changes are gone for good.  It is very easy
  to forget that you have some unfinished work on an unpublished
  feature branch or even in a stash.

  Actually there are some safety precautions in place, that might
  help you out if you make an unwise choice here, but don't count
  on it.  In case of emergency, stay calm and check the stash and
  the `trash-directory' for traces of lost work.

Various:

  `kill-process' There seldom is a reason to kill a process.

Global settings:

  Instead of adding all of the above symbols to the value of this
  option you can also set it to the atom `t', which has the same
  effect as adding all of the above symbols.  Doing that most
  certainly is a bad idea, especially because other symbols might
  be added in the future.  So even if you don't want to be asked
  for confirmation for any of these actions, you are still better
  of adding all of the respective symbols individually.

  When `magit-wip-before-change-mode' is enabled then these actions
  can fairly easily be undone: `discard', `reverse',
  `stage-all-changes', and `unstage-all-changes'.  If and only if
  this mode is enabled, then `safe-with-wip' has the same effect
  as adding all of these symbols individually."

  "Read a choice in the minibuffer, or use the default choice.

This is the function that Magit commands use when they need the
user to select a single thing to act on.  The arguments have the
same meaning as for `completing-read', except for FALLBACK, which
is unique to this function and is described below.

Instead of asking the user to choose from a list of possible
candidates, this function may instead just return the default
specified by DEF, with or without requiring user confirmation.
Whether that is the case depends on PROMPT, `this-command' and
`magit-dwim-selection'.  See the documentation of the latter for
more information.

If it does use the default without the user even having to
confirm that, then `magit-completing-read--silent-default' is set
to t, otherwise nil.

If it does read a value in the minibuffer, then this function
acts similarly to `completing-read', except for the following:

- If REQUIRE-MATCH is nil and the user exits without a choice,
  then nil is returned instead of an empty string.

- If REQUIRE-MATCH is non-nil and the users exits without a
  choice, an user-error is raised.

- FALLBACK specifies a secondary default that is only used if
  the primary default DEF is nil.  The secondary default is not
  subject to `magit-dwim-selection' — if DEF is nil but FALLBACK
  is not, then this function always asks the user to choose a
  candidate, just as if both defaults were nil.

- \": \" is appended to PROMPT.

- PROMPT is modified to end with \" (default DEF|FALLBACK): \"
  provided that DEF or FALLBACK is non-nil, that neither
  `ivy-mode' nor `helm-mode' is enabled, and that
  `magit-completing-read-function' is set to its default value of
