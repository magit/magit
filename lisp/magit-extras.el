  "Control how `magit-pop-revision-stack' inserts a revision.

The command `magit-pop-revision-stack' inserts a representation
of the revision last pushed to the `magit-revision-stack' into
the current buffer.  It inserts text at point and/or near the end
of the buffer, and removes the consumed revision from the stack.

The entries on the stack have the format (HASH TOPLEVEL) and this
option has the format (POINT-FORMAT EOB-FORMAT INDEX-REGEXP), all
of which may be nil or a string (though either one of EOB-FORMAT
or POINT-FORMAT should be a string, and if INDEX-REGEXP is
non-nil, then the two formats should be too).

First INDEX-REGEXP is used to find the previously inserted entry,
by searching backward from point.  The first submatch must match
the index number.  That number is incremented by one, and becomes
the index number of the entry to be inserted.  If you don't want
to number the inserted revisions, then use nil for INDEX-REGEXP.

If INDEX-REGEXP is non-nil, then both POINT-FORMAT and EOB-FORMAT
should contain \"%N\", which is replaced with the number that was
determined in the previous step.

Both formats, if non-nil and after removing %N, are then expanded
using `git show --format=FORMAT ...' inside TOPLEVEL.

The expansion of POINT-FORMAT is inserted at point, and the
expansion of EOB-FORMAT is inserted at the end of the buffer (if
the buffer ends with a comment, then it is inserted right before
that)."

  "Insert a representation of a revision into the current buffer.

Pop a revision from the `magit-revision-stack' and insert it into
the current buffer according to `magit-pop-revision-stack-format'.
Revisions can be put on the stack using `magit-copy-section-value'
and `magit-copy-buffer-revision'.

If the stack is empty or with a prefix argument, instead read a
revision in the minibuffer.  By using the minibuffer history this
allows selecting an item which was popped earlier or to insert an
arbitrary reference or revision without first pushing it onto the
stack.

When reading the revision from the minibuffer, then it might not
be possible to guess the correct repository.  When this command
is called inside a repository (e.g. while composing a commit
message), then that repository is used.  Otherwise (e.g. while
composing an email) then the repository recorded for the top
element of the stack is used (even though we insert another
revision).  If not called inside a repository and with an empty
stack, or with two prefix arguments, then read the repository in
the minibuffer too."
