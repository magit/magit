;;; Commentary:

;; This package teaches Magit to use functions provided by the
;; `libegit2' module to perform certain tasks.  That module used the
;; Libgit2 implementation of the Git core methods and is implemented
;; in the `libgit' package.

;; The hope is that using a C module instead of calling out to `git'
;; all the time increases performance; especially on Windows where
;; starting a process is unreasonably slow.

;; This package is still experimental and not many functions have been
;; reimplemented to use `libgit' yet.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'eieio)
(require 'seq)
(require 'subr-x)

(require 'magit-git)

(require 'libgit)

;;; Utilities

(defun magit-libgit-repo (&optional directory)
  "Return an object for the repository in DIRECTORY.
If optional DIRECTORY is nil, then use `default-directory'."
  (when-let ((default-directory
               (let ((magit-inhibit-libgit t))
                 (magit-gitdir directory))))
    (magit--with-refresh-cache
        (cons default-directory 'magit-libgit-repo)
      (libgit-repository-open default-directory))))

;;; Methods

(cl-defmethod magit-bare-repo-p
  (&context ((magit-gitimpl) (eql libgit)) &optional noerror)
  (and (magit--assert-default-directory noerror)
       (if-let ((repo (magit-libgit-repo)))
           (libgit-repository-bare-p repo)
         (unless noerror
           (signal 'magit-outside-git-repo default-directory)))))
