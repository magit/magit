  "Whether certain commands require verification before pushing.

Starting with v2.1.0 some of the push commands are supposed to
push to the configured upstream branch without requiring user
confirmation or offering to push somewhere else.

This has taken a few users by surprise, and they suggested that
we force users to opt-in to this behavior.  Unfortunately adding
this option means that now other users will complain about us
needlessly forcing them to set an option.  But what can you do?
\(I am not making this up.  This has happened in the past and it
is very frustrating.)

You should set the value of this option to nil, causing all push
commands to behave as intended:

`PP' Push the current branch to its upstream branch, no questions
     asked.  If no upstream branch is configured or if that is
     another local branch, then prompt for the remote and branch
     to push to.

`Po' Push another local branch (not the current branch) to its
     upstream branch.  If no upstream branch is configured or if
     that is another local branch, then prompt for the remote and
     branch to push to.

`Pe' Push any local branch to any remote branch.  This command
     isn't affected by this option.  It always asks which branch
     should be pushed (defaulting to the current branch) and then
     where that should be pushed (defaulting to the upstream
     branch of the previously selected branch).

There are other push commands besides these.  You should read
their doc-strings instead of blindly trying them out and then
being surprised if it turns out that they do something different
from what you expected.  For example inside the push popup type
`?i' to learn what \"implicitly\" means here.  Or to learn about
all push commands at once, consult the manual.

While I have your attention, I would also like to warn you that
pushing will be further improved in a later release (probably
v2.3.0), and that you might be surprised by some of these
changes, unless you read the documentation.

Setting this option to t makes little sense.  If you consider
doing that, then you should probably just use `Pe' instead of
`PP' or `Po'."
