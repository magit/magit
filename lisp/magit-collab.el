;;; Commentary:

;; This library implements various collaboration tools.  These tools
;; are only early incarnation -- implementing collaboration tools is
;; a top priority for future development.

;; Currently these tools (including `magit-branch-pull-request', which
;; is defined elsewhere) only support Github, but support for other
;; Git forges as well as mailing list based collaboration is in
;; planning.

;;; Code:

(require 'magit)
(require 'ghub)

;;; Variables

(defvar magit-github-token-scopes '(repo)
  "The Github API scopes needed by Magit.

`repo' is the only required scope.  Without this scope none of
Magit's features that use the API work.  Instead of this scope
you could use `public_repo' if you are only interested in public
repositories.

`repo' Grants read/write access to code, commit statuses,
  invitations, collaborators, adding team memberships, and
  deployment statuses for public and private repositories
  and organizations.

`public_repo' Grants read/write access to code, commit statuses,
  collaborators, and deployment statuses for public repositories
  and organizations. Also required for starring public
  repositories.")
