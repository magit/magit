;;; Commentary:

;; This library defines several utility functions used by several
;; other libraries which cannot depend on one another (because
;; circular dependencies are not good).  Luckily most (all) of these
;; functions have very little (nothing) to do with Git, so we not only
;; have to do this, it even makes sense.

;; Unfortunately there are also some options which are used by several
;; libraries which cannot depend on one another, they are defined here
;; too.

;; And finally, some users insist on using ancient Emacsen, making
;; backward compatibility definitions necessary.  They too are placed
;; here.

(defcustom magit-no-confirm nil
  "A list of symbols for actions Magit should not confirm, or t.

Many potentially dangerous commands by default ask the user for
confirmation.  Each of the below symbols stands for an action
which, when invoked unintentionally or without being fully aware
of the consequences, could lead to tears.  In many cases there
are more than one command which performs a certain action, so
we don't use the command names but more generic symbols.

Applying changes:

  `discard' Discarding one or more changes (i.e. hunks or the
  complete diff for a file) loses that change, obviously.

  `reverse' Reverting one or more changes can usually be undone
  by reverting the reversion.

  `stage-all-changes', `unstage-all-changes' When there are both
  staged and unstaged changes, then un-/staging everything would
  destroy that distinction.  Of course that also applies when
  un-/staging a single change, but then less is lost and one does
  that so often that having to confirm every time would be
  unacceptable.

Files:

  `delete' When a file that isn't yet tracked by Git is deleted
  then it is completely lost, not just the last changes.  Very
  dangerous.

  `trash' Instead of deleting a file it can also be move to the
  system trash.  Obviously much less dangerous than deleting it.

  Also see option `magit-delete-by-moving-to-trash'.

  `resurrect' A deleted file can easily be resurrected by
  \"deleting\" the deletion, which is done using the same command
  that was used to delete the same file in the first place.

  `rename' Renaming a file can easily be undone.

Sequences:

  `reset-bisect' Aborting (known to Git as \"resetting\") a
  bisect operation loses all information collected so far.

  `abort-merge' Aborting a merge throws away all conflict
  resolutions which has already been carried out by the user.

  `merge-dirty' Merging with a dirty worktree can make it hard to
  go back to the state before the merge was initiated.

References:

  `delete-unmerged-branch' Once a branch has been deleted it can
  only be restored using low-level recovery tools provided by
  Git.  And even then the reflog is gone.  The user always has
  to confirm the deletion of a branch by accepting the default
  choice (or selecting another branch), but when a branch has
  not been merged yet, also make sure the user is aware of that.

  `drop-stashes' Dropping a stash is dangerous because Git stores
  them in the reflog, once it is removed there is no going back
  without using low-level recovery tools provided by Git.  When a
  single stash is dropped, then the user always has to confirm by
  accepting the default (or selecting another).  This action only
  concerns the deletion of multiple stages at once.

Various:

  `kill-process' There seldom is a reason to kill a process.

Global settings:

  Instead of adding all of the above symbols to the value of this
  option you can also set it to the atom `t', which has the same
  effect as adding all of the above symbols.  Doing that most
  certainly is a bad idea, especially because other symbols might
  be added in the future.  So even if you don't want to be asked
  for confirmation for any of these actions, you are still better
  of adding all of the respective symbols individually.

  `safe-with-backup' When `magit-backup-mode' is enabled then
  some of the above actions can be fairly easily undone.  Adding
  this symbol to the value has the same effect as adding `discard',
  `reverse', `stage-all-changes', and `unstage-all-changes', but
  only if the mode is enabled in the current buffer.  When the
  option `magit-backup-untracked' is non-nil, then that extends
  to `delete' and `trash'.  Before you add this symbol you should
  practice restoring a backup stash from `magit-backup-list'."

  "Magit wrapper around `completing-read' or an alternative function.

Option `magit-completing-read-function' can be used to wrap
around another `completing-read'-like function.  Unless it
doesn't have the exact same signature, an additional wrapper is
required.  Even if it has the same signature it might be a good
idea to wrap it, so that `magit-prompt-with-default' can be used.

See `completing-read' for the meanings of the arguments, but note
that this wrapper makes the following changes:

- If REQUIRE-MATCH is nil and the user exits without a choice,
  then return nil instead of an empty string.

- If REQUIRE-MATCH is non-nil and the users exits without a
  choice, then raise an user-error.

- \": \" is appended to PROMPT.

- If a `magit-completing-read-function' is used which in turn
  uses `magit-prompt-with-completion' and DEF is non-nil, then
  PROMPT is modified to end with \" (default DEF): \".
