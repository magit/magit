Getting help
============

**When something doesn't work as expected then please first see the
[FAQ][faq].** Then also try the list of [open issues][issues] and use
the search box at the top of that page to find older related issues.
You should also consult the [manual][manual] and ask a general-purpose
search engine.

If everything else fails then ask for help on the
**[Emacs Stackexchange site][forum]**, the
[mailing list][list], or the
[Gitter chat][chat].

Reporting issues and suggesting features
========================================

To report bugs and suggest new feature use the [issue tracker][issues].

Never use the phrase "at the very least".

Code contributions
==================

If you have some code which you would like to be merged, then open a
[pull requests][pulls].  Please create atomic commits with descriptive
commit messages.

Donations
=========

Please also consider to contribute by making a
[monetary donation][donations].
