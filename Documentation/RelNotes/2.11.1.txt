Magit v2.11.1 Release Notes (unreleased)
========================================

Changes since v2.11.0
---------------------

* Added new commands `magit-previous-line' and `magit-next-line' as
  substitutes for `previous-line' and `next-line'.  Magit's selection
  mechanism is based on the region but selects an area that is larger
  than the region.  This causes shift selection to select two lines on
  the first invocation when using the vanilla commands.  When invoked
  inside the body of a hunk the new Magit-specific variants don't move
  point on the first invocation and thereby they only selects a single
  line.  Which inconsistency you prefer is a matter of preference.  #2912

  To use the Magit-specific variants add this to your init file:

    (define-key magit-mode-map [remap previous-line] 'magit-previous-line)
    (define-key magit-mode-map [remap next-line] 'magit-next-line)

* The command `magit-refs-popup' now remembers arguments and they are
  displayed in the header-line of `magit-refs-mode' buffers.  The popup
  command still invokes the default action by default when invoked from
  another buffer, but when invoked from a `magit-refs-mode' buffer it
  now shows the popup.  #2898

* Added new command `magit-branch-or-checkout' as a potential
  substitute for `magit-checkout'.  Setup instructions can be found in
  the manual.  #3104

* Added new customizable options `magit-log-highlight-keywords' and
  `magit-diff-highlight-keywords' which control whether text inside
  brackets is highlighted in magit-log and magit-diff buffers
  respectively.  #3190

Fixes since v2.11.0
-------------------

* `git-rebase-mode-show-keybindings' failed to process non-English
  usage instructions in interactive rebase buffers.  #3175
