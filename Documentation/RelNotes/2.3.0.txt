It's Magit!  A Git Porcelain inside Emacs
=========================================

Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

Magit v2.3.0 Release Notes
==========================

UNRELEASED.

Changes since v2.2.0
--------------------

THIS IS NOT COMPLETE.

* Added `--interactive' switch to `magit-rebase-popup' so that rebase
  variants which normally perform a non-interactive rebase can be used
  interactively too.  #2186

* Commands that perform an interactive rebase should no longer be used
  non-interactively.  #2187

* Rebasing commands now can start with a root commit.  #2187

* New command `magit-checkout-file'.

* Added new option `magit-bury-buffer-function' to give users more
  control over how Magit buffers are buried, replacing the old binary
  option `magit-restore-window-configuration'.  The default is still
  the same, i.e. `magit-restore-window-configuration' is used.  #2193

* Added new function `magit-mode-quit-window' as a simpler variant to
  `magit-restore-window-configuration'.  #2193

* Information about related refs in `magit-revision-mode' buffers are
  now grouped in the same section as other headers and are formatted
  like those other headers instead of like diffstats.  The redundant
  header which previously grouped the related refs section is gone.
  All headers are inserted by the new `magit-insert-revision-headers'
  section inserter.  #2216

* No longer avoid calling git more than absolutely necessary when
  creating a `magit-revision-mode' buffer.  This simplifies parsing,
  makes it simpler to prettify how information is presented, allows
  users to customize how and in what order information is presented,
  and prepares for faster, asynchronously created diffs.  #2216

* The various sections in revision buffers are now inserted using new
  section inserters named `magit-insert-revision-{*}', all of which
  are part of the default value of `magit-revision-sections-hook'.
  #2216

* The various sections in diff buffers are now inserted using new
  section inserters named `magit-insert-diff-{*}', all of which are
  part of the default value of `magit-diff-sections-hook'.  #2216

* Added new option `magit-revision-headers-format' whose value is
  passed to `git show --format=' to insert most of the headers,
  excluding the related-refs headers.  The default value now uses
  placeholders which respect information in the file ".mailmap".
  #2216

* Removed options `magit-revision-show-notes',
  `magit-diff-show-xref-buttons', `magit-revision-show-xref-buttons',
  `magit-diff-show-diffstat', and `magit-revision-show-diffstat'.
  Whether these sections are inserted is now controlled using the
  hooks `magit-diff-section-hook' and `magit-revision-section-hook'.
  #2216

* Gravatar images are now shown in `magit-revision-buffers' be
  default.  New option `magit-revision-show-gravatars' controls
  whether these images should be inserted and can also be used to
  adjust to customization of `magit-revision-headers-format'.  #2216

* After using the region to stage or discard parts of a hunk, point is
  now placed on the beginning of the next or previous block of changed
  lines.  Previously we just jumped to the beginning of the hunk at
  the same index as the previous hunk, but that often was very far
  away from where point was before the refresh.  #2227

* The function `magit-toplevel' was refactored and many tests were
  added.  It now returns the correct value when a symlink to a
  sub-directory of a working tree is involved.  #2242

* New option `magit-keep-region-overlay' allows displaying the region
  overlay together with the visualization of a valid Magit selection.
  See the doc-string for why you don't want to do that, but if you
  disagree then you can now have it your way.  #2091

* Renamed `magit-file-buffer-mode' to `magit-file-mode'.  Related
  symbols were renamed accordingly.

* Added new minor mode `magit-blob-mode' and new commands
  `magit-blob-previous' and `magit-blob-next'.  #2195

* Added a revision stack.  The new commands `magit-copy-section-value'
  and `magit-copy-buffer-revision', which are intended for use inside
  Magit buffers, push an entry to the stack, and the new command
  `magit-pop-revision-stack' inserts a representation into an editable
  buffer.  New option `magit-pop-revision-stack-format' controls how
  the representation of the revision is formatted.  The old commands
  `magit-copy-as-kill' and `magit-copy-buffer-thing-as-kill' have been
  removed.  #2225

* Added new option `magit-log-remove-graph-args'.  #2226

* Added support for showing actionable diffs inside logs.  #2226

* Added basic support for tracing the evolution of a region.  #2226

* Added new command `magit-stash-format-patch'.

* The signatures of `magit-mode-setup' and `magit-mode-get-buffer'
  have changed, and `magit-mode-get-buffer-create' has been removed.
  Extensions have to be adjusted accordingly.  #2282.

* All Magit-Mode buffers (including process buffers, but excluding
  popup, blob-visiting, and file-visiting buffers, whose major-modes
  do not derive from `magit-mode' and therefore aren't "Magit-Mode
  buffers") are now displayed using `magit-display-buffer', which is a
  wrapper around the low-level `display-buffer'.  High-level functions
  such as `pop-to-buffer' and `switch-to-buffer' are no longer used to
  display Magit buffers.

  `magit-display-buffer' uses the function specified by the new option
  `magit-display-buffer-function' to actually display the buffer in
  some window.  The default value is `magit-display-buffer-traditional'.
  By implementing their own variant to wrap around `display-buffer',
  users can take complete control over how Magit buffers are displayed.
  It's also possible to use `display-buffer' directly and specify the
  display actions in `display-buffer-alist'.

  Added new options `magit-pre-display-buffer-hook' and
  `magit-post-display-buffer-hook', and removed the options
  `magit-status-buffer-switch-function' and
  `magit-diff-switch-buffer-function'.  #2282

* Added new options `magit-generate-buffer-name-function',
  `magit-buffer-name-format', and `magit-uniquify-buffer-names',
  replacing the various `magit-{*}-buffer-name-format' options.  #2282
