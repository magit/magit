Magit v2.9.0 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Breaking changes since v2.8.0
-----------------------------

* For historic reasons "RET" behaved differently in `magit-refs-mode'
  than anywhere else.  "RET" is one of Magit's most essential key
  bindings and users quickly learn that regardless of what is actually
  at point, it always shows more information about that thing in
  another buffer.  It can be very confusing if the references buffer
  breaks this convention.

  Now `magit-visit-ref' behaves just like `magit-show-commit' even in
  `magit-refs-mode' buffers.  By default at least; you can easily
  revert this change using:

    (setq magit-visit-ref-behavior '(checkout-any focus-on-ref))

  However we recommend that you instead press "b b RET" to checkout
  the reference at point, just like you always had to do in other
  buffers.  And "C-u y o RET" to make commit counts and lists of
  cherries commits relative to the reference at point.

  Furthermore the option `magit-visit-ref-create' was removed.  If you
  previously had that set to `t', then you can achieve the same using:

    (add-to-list 'magit-visit-ref-behavior 'create-branch)

  However we recommend that you instead press "b c RET RET", just like
  you always had to do in other buffers.

* The option `magit-branch-popup-show-variables' now defaults to `nil',
  which results in changes to some key bindings.  "b u", for example,
  is now "b C u" and, as before, is also available at "f C u", "F C u"
  and "P C u".

  Even though we generally avoid changing key bindings we did so in
  this case to avoid confusing new users with an overly complex branch
  popup and for consistency with the alternative bindings mentioned
  above.

  You can easily revert this change using:

    (setq magit-branch-popup-show-variables t)

* The option `magit-popup-show-common-commands' now defaults to `nil'.

  This was done to make popups less noisy but increases the odds
  that some users will never become aware of the common commands.
  To counter that, the usage instructions displayed in the echo area
  now also mention the key that can be used to show these commands
  temporarily.

  You can easily revert this change using:

    (setq magit-popup-show-common-commands t)

* The option `magit-popup-use-prefix-argument' defaults to `default'
  now, meaning that the use of a prefix argument causes the popup's
  default action to be invoked directly without the popup being shown
  first.

  Previously the use of a prefix argument did not invoke the popup
  or its default action, and instead informed users that they had to
  choose what behavior they wanted and that they had to set the option
  accordingly.  Doing that was necessary three years ago, when the
  default behavior changed when "magit-key-mode.el" was replaced with
  "magit-popup.el".  Now we don't need that safety net anymore.

* By default Git-Commit no longer complains about a summary line that
  is too long by some standards.  You can easily revert this change
  using:

    (add-to-list 'git-commit-style-convention-checks
                 'overlong-summary-line)

* In buffers used to write commit messages `fill-column' is no longer
  set to 72.  Instead the default value 70 is used (or whatever local
  value is set up through other means).  You can easily revert this
  change using:

    (setq git-commit-fill-column 72)

* The margin that by default is displayed in pure log buffers and
  optionally in some other buffers that contain logs is now more
  flexible and easier to customize.

  For each mode that supports the margin there now exists a dedicated
  option named `magit-*-margin', which controls whether the margin is
  shown initially, whether the author name is displayed in addition
  to the committer date, and how that committer date is formatted.
  All of these options can be found in the new `magit-margin' Custom
  group.

  It is now possible to show the actual committer date, using a time
  format of your choosing.  Previously the only option was to display
  the age of the commit.

  The old options that were previously used to configure the margin
  have been removed.  If you have customized `magit-log-show-margin',
  `magit-reflog-show-margin' and/or `magit-refs-show-margin', then you
  now have to customize the respective new variable whose names do not
  contain "-show".  The same applies if you have previously changed
  the value of `magit-log-margin-spec'.  Unfortunately this cannot be
  automated because the format of the values has changed and because
  the old customizations do not unambiguously map to the new options.

  You might also want to customize the options `magit-status-margin',
  `magit-stashes-margin' and `magit-log-select-margin', for all of
  which no corresponding `magit-*-show-margin' used to exist.

  If you choose to display the commit dates instead of the commit
  ages in all supported modes, then you should set `magit-log-margin'
  before loading `magit'.  If you do that then the default values of
  the other `magit-*-margin' options will use the same commit date
  style without you having to customize each option individually.

Changes since v2.8.0
--------------------

* The new option `magit-branch-adjust-remote-upstream-alist' can be
  used to configure what branch to use as upstream when branching a
  remote branch.  Without setting this option the upstream ends up
  being the same branch as the one referred to by the push-remote.

* The per-refresh cache, which is used to save calls to git because
  that is surprisingly slow on Windows, has been improved for calls to
  `git config'.  Instead of just avoiding identical calls to `git
  config' as for other sub-commands, we now call `git config --list'
  only once per refresh to obtain a list of all variables and their
  values.

* Visiting a file or blob by pressing "RET" (or always visiting the
  file by pressing "M-RET") while point is inside a diff has been
  improved in several ways.

  The position we jump to is now accurate even when jumping to the
  file in the working tree from a diff that wasn't about changes in
  the working tree.

  If, and only if, point is on a removed line in the diff, then we
  jump to the last commit which still had that line, not the commit
  which removed that line.  Staged changes are currently excluded from
  this new behavior, and it can be disabled completely using the new
  option `magit-diff-visit-previous-blob'.

  If, and only if, the file/blob buffer is narrowed to a region that
  does not include the position we jump to, then it is widened first.

* Hunk refinement is now faster.  Users who previously set
  `magit-diff-refine-hunk' to `nil' due to performance issues may
  find that it now works well even when set to `all'.

* The new options `magit-diff-highlight-hunk-region-functions' and
  `magit-diff-unmarked-lines-keep-foreground' (which was previously
  defined as an undocumented variable) allow tuning the appearance
  of the hunk-internal region.

  The new function `magit-diff-highlight-hunk-region-using-face',
  provides a new style; it makes the hunk-internal region bold (or
  italic).  I recommend you customize the above option to use this
  function instead of one of the functions mentioned below.

  The new functions `magit-diff-highlight-hunk-region-using-overlay'
  and `magit-diff-highlight-hunk-region-using-overlay' draw one-pixel
  lines before and after the hunk-internal region.  Both of these
  functions have (different) glitches and due to limitations of Emacs'
  display engine it is not possible to fix those.  #2758

* Added command `magit-find-git-config-file' and variants to make it
  easier to open a file located in the git directory when ".git" is
  a regular file whose contents describe the location of the real git
  directory.

* Added command `magit-emacs-Q-command' to make troubleshooting and
  bug reporting easier for users not installing from the git
  repository. #2856

* The command `magit-branch-spinoff' learned to remove only a subset
  of commits from the previously current branch, instead of resetting
  it to its upstream, when the region selects commits reachable from
  HEAD.

* The command `magit-branch-delete' now falls back to deleting the
  tracking branch when the user attempts to delete a remote branch
  which does not actually exist on the remote anymore.

* The command `magit-diff-dwim' learned about additional cases.  On
  a non-current branch it now shows the diff for "CURRENT...BRANCH"
  (instead of "BRANCH..CURRENT") and inside a stash buffer it shows
  the diff for the commit at point.

* The command `magit-push', which "o" is bound to in the push popup,
  now offers the push-branch as default choice.  Only if that is not
  set does it default to the upstream as before.  And when pushing a
  commit that is reachable from HEAD, then it offers to push to the
  push-branch or upstream of the current branch (which still has to
  be forced explicitly).

* Added option `magit-no-confirm-default' to allow specifying commands
  which should just use the default choice instead of having the user
  confirm that by pressing RET.  I recommend you don't use this, but
  if you think that the defaults are so good that you always want to
  use them, then this might make it a bit easier for you.

* Added option `magit-slow-confirm' for users who are afraid they
  would answer `y-or-n-p' questions to quickly.  One action, deleting
  all stashes, now defaults to having to be confirmed with "yes RET".

* The option `magit-branch-prefer-remote-upstream' now also supports
  regexps as members instead of only complete branch names.

* The option `magit-branch-read-upstream-first' used to be a boolean.
  Now it supports a third value `fallback', which means to read the
  upstream first like `t', but if the value provided by the user does
  not reference an existing revision, then it is treated as the name of
  the new branch and the upstream is read using the second prompt, as
  if the value of this option were `nil'.

* When deleting a stash, the hash is now logged to the process log
  buffer in addition to *Messages*, making it more likely that a
  user who accidentally deleted a stash would find the information
  required to undo that.

* The environment variable `INSIDE_EMACS' is now set when calling git.

* Added support for new gpg status letters X, Y, R, and E.

* Added `hl-line-mode' to `magit-repolist-hook' and
  `magit-submodule-list-hook' and defined those hooks explicitly.

* Added the `--gpg-sign=' option to the revert popup.

* Added the `--sort=' option to the show-refs popup.  (Use "C-u y" to
  show the popup instead of invoking its default action as "y" does.)

* Added new faces `git-rebase-comment-heading'
  and `git-rebase-comment-hash'.

* `whitespace-mode' is not compatible with Magit buffers, where it is
  now actively prevented from being turned on by the user.

* Log commands now support completion of refs in the "refs/tags" and
  "refs/pull" namespaces.  #2878

Fixes since v2.8.0
------------------

* The command `magit-list-repositories' failed on empty repositories.

* The Git variable `pull.rebase' was ignored when determining whether
  the current branch is being rebased onto its upstream in order to
  display that information in the status buffer.

* On 32bit systems `magit-format-log-margin' failed because it tried
  to truncate a time float that was too large for that.  #2765

* On Emacs v25.1 the hunk-internal region flashed briefly on
  mouse-down-1 events and the delimiting horizontal lines could end
  up having the height of a regular line instead of just a single
  pixel.  #2758

* On Windows, when using a `windows-nt' Emacs together with a cygwin
  Git, we failed to instruct Emacs to not use dos shell quoting when
  calling git.  And if Git wasn't available, then that caused an
  error, which prevented Magit from being loaded.

* The encoding of commit messages is controlled by the Git variable
  `i18n.logOutputEncoding' but we failed to take that into account.
  Fixes by setting `i18n.logOutputEncoding' to UTF-8, but only inside
  Magit and only for `window-nt'.

* File and directory local variables were not honored in the buffers
  used to write commit messages.

* The caching mechanism that is supposed to ensure that sections of
  unpulled and unpushed commits remain collapsed even when they
  disappear was broken for a while.

* Process sentinels did not in all cases ensure that the correct
  buffer was current before doing something that assumes that this is
  the case.  Almost always that did not matter because it was the case
  anyway, but if other timers are running then it is possible that
  those make the wrong buffer current.

* Process sentinels and filters used when blaming assumed that the
  `exit' process status indicates success.  #2836

* The commands `magit-clone' and `magit-init' did not work over Tramp.

* The commands `magit-worktree-checkout' and `magit-worktree-branch'
  did not expand the path they pass to git, which is necessary because
  git does not know the meaning of "~/".

* The commands which create fixup/squash commands and then immediately
  squash them into the target commit did not remove `--gpg-sign' or
  add `--no-gpg-sign'.  Signing such commits is not only unnecessary;
  unless the passphrase was cached earlier, trying to sign resulted in
  the process indefinitely waiting for the passphrase to arrive with
  no way for the user to actually provide it.

* Depending on the value of `magit-save-repository-buffers' the user
  might have been asked whether s/he wants to save "git-rebase-todo",
  which is never necessary and just a distraction.

* The function `magit-save-repository-buffers' did not follow symlinks.
  #2843

* Directories whose names begin with a period were filtered out when
  using `magit-repository-directories' to calculate a list of repos.

* The user name and email, which are displayed when reading a gpg key
  from the user, were not stripped from the chosen value before being
  handed of to git.

* When the upstream of the current branch is a remote whose url isn't
  configured then that caused an error when refreshing the status
  buffer.

* When visiting a directory by displaying a Dired buffer, we used to
  display a buffer for the parent of the directory in question and
  placed point on the name of the directory.  But the intention always
  was to show the Dired buffer for the directory itself.

* Visiting or deleting a submodule listed inside "Modules" failed.
  The latter is now done by de-initalizing the module.

* The highlighting of a non-empty second line in a commit message was
  not automatically updated.

* When `--force-with-lease' was added to the `magit-push-popup',
  `--force' was removed, but sometimes the former just isn't enough.

* The face `magit-diff-file-heading-highlight' used to inherit from
  `magit-diff-file-heading', which by default makes text bold.  That
  resulted in the complete current heading to be bold, but only the
  file-name part is supposed to be bold.

* The manual stated that "DEL" in Git Rebase mode was bound to
  `magit-diff-show-or-scroll-down', which was not the case.  A new
  command `git-rebase-show-or-scroll-down` has been added and bound to
  "DEL" to provide this functionality.

* The function `magit-repolist-status' did not expand the filename
  which may be necessary when listing submodules.

* The log margin did not show the author of stashes.  #2846

* Buffers visiting a blob used the file's directory as
  `default-directory' even when that directory did not exist in the
  working tree.  The top-level directory is now used as
  `default-directory' when the subdirectory does not exist.

This release also contains typofixes, documentation updates,
code clean-ups, and other small bug fixes and improvements.
