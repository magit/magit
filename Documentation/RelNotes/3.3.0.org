* Magit v3.3.0 Release Notes (unreleased)
** Breaking changes
** Changes since v3.2.0

- No longer automatically add ~--full-history~ when showing log for a
  single file that isn't being tracked anymore.  #4381

- ~magit-stash-both~ now asks before discarding merge state.  #4345

- Several infix arguments that previously could only be disabled
  or have a numeric value can now also be enabled without having
  an explicit numeric value.  #4379

- Added ~-Xignore-space-change~ and ~-Xignore-all-space~ to ~magit-merge~.
  Like most newly added expert arguments they have to be explicitly
  [[https://magit.vc/manual/transient/Enabling-and-Disabling-Suffixes.html][revealed]].  #4387

- Added new command ~magit-status-quick~, which shows the status buffer
  but avoids refreshing it for performance reasons.  #4259

- Added new commands ~magit-display-repository-buffer~ (bound to ~j~ in
  Magit buffers) and ~magit-switch-to-repository-buffer~ (bound to ~J~)
  and variants for switching to any existing Magit buffer belonging
  to the current repository.  #4259

- A few existing commands got a new or better binding in
  ~magit-dispatch~ and/or ~magit-mode-map~.

** Fixes since v3.2.0

- Make ~magit-branch-remote-head~ and ~magit-branch-current~ fall back
  to ~:inverse-video~ when the ~:box~ attribute isn't support, i.e. in
  a terminal.  If this change does not have any effect for you then
  your theme probably changes these faces and should stop doing so.
  #4206
