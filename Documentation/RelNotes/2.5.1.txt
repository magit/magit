Magit v2.5.1 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Updates since v2.5.0
--------------------

* Added a cache, which memorizes the values of some function calls for
  the duration of a refresh.  This cuts the calls to git in half.

* Added new command `magit-diff-buffer-file-popup' intended for use in
  file-visiting buffers.  It shows the same popup as `magit-diff-popup'
  but starts out already limited to the visited file.

* Added new command `magit-push-refspecs', which allows pushing using
  one or more comma-separated and refspecs, which are explicitly typed
  in the minibuffer.

* Added new commands `magit-fetch-refspec' and `magit-fetch-branch'.

* Added new command `magit-reset-popup' featuring all the available
  reset variants.

* When using Ido completion, then it's now possible to fall back to
  regular completion using `C-x C-f' or `C-x C-b' if necessary.

* When washing the diff that is to be displayed while writing a
  commit message takes too long, then it is now possible to abort that
  by pressing `C-g'.  Previously that would have aborted the commit.

* When `magit-process-raise-error' is non-nil, then the displayed
  error message now also mentions the `default-directory', which is
  useful when using Magit as a library in another packages that runs
  git in many different repositories.

Fixes since v2.5.0
------------------

* If the user sets the variable `magit-auto-revert-mode' or the
  obsolete alias `magit-revert-buffers' to nil anytime during startup,
  before or after `magit-autorevert' is loaded, then the mode is not
  turned on (actually it is explicitly turned off).

* `magit-insert-unpulled-from-pushremote' and
  `magit-insert-unpushed-to-pushremote' missed an edge case when
  checking whether their section should be inserted into the status
  buffer.

* `magit-clone' did not switch to the cloned repo before trying to
  delete the symbolic-ref "origin/HEAD".

* `magit-merge-preview' did not recognize sections for added or
  deleted files.

* `magit-run-git-with-input' had stopped calling
  `magit-pre-call-git-hook' and logging its git command to the
  magit-process buffer.

* When a revision buffer was limited to a set of files, its header
  line did not say so.

* On `windows-nt' systems, having `mount' in `exec-path' caused Magit
  to assume that git is from Cygwin.

* Invoking `magit-commit-popup's default action failed due to a typo.

This release also contains documentation updates.
