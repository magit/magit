Magit v2.11.0 Release Notes (unreleased)
========================================

Changes since v2.10.3
---------------------

* The popup `magit-remote-popup' now exposes the `-f' switch for `git
  remote add', which allows the user to control whether information
  from the remote is fetched after the remote is added.  The default
  behavior is still to fetch after adding a remote (i.e., the switch
  is enabled by default).  #2997

* Added option `magit-list-refs-sortby' to allow more control over the
  order of refs in prompts.  #2872

* The Magit wrappers around the default Emacs completion functions now
  override the default behavior of alphabetically sorting choices when
  displaying them in the "*Completions*" buffer.  In repositories with
  many release tags, the new behavior prevents completion prompts from
  being dominated by version tags instead of branch names.  #2925

* The commands `magit-git-command', `magit-git-command-topdir',
  `magit-shell-command', and `magit-shell-command-topdir' now use
  `read-shell-command' to read the command and a shell to run it.
  Packages like `pcmpl-git' and `bash-completion' can now be used
  to get command-line completion when using these commands.  #2951

* The commands `magit-git-command' and `magit-git-command-topdir' can
  now call arbitrary commands.  The initial-value when reading the
  command is "git ", and you can remove that to call something else.
  #2951

* Added option `magit-shell-command-verbose-prompt'.  #2951

* The function `magit-branch-or-commit-at-point' now offers the
  appropriate default choice in a `magit-merge-preview-mode' buffer
  and in blob-visiting buffers.  #3039, #3066

* On Travis tests are now run against all supported Emacs releases, as
  well as against snapshots of the `master' and `emacs-25' branches.
  #3046

* Added command `magit-debug-git-executable'.  #3044

* Added new function `magit-display-file-buffer-other-window' to be
  used as `magit-display-file-buffer-function'.

* Added `--mainline' switch to `magit-revert-popup'.  #3018

* Added `magit-file-checkout' to `magit-reset-popup'.  #3052

* When a revision is shown from a log buffer, the revision buffer now
  inherits the file restriction of the log buffer.  #3056

* Add new command `magit-revision-toggle-file-filter'.  #3062

* Add new option `magit-use-sticky-arguments' that provides more
  control over how diff and log commands reuse arguments from existing
  buffers.  #3074

* Add imenu support in log, revision, and status buffers.  #3022

Fixes since v2.10.3
-------------------

* Rebasing was sometimes interrupted by an error about the index lock
  already being held.  This happened because VC asynchronously checks
  for files with conflict, which involved using a git command that
  grabs the lock.  Magit now redefines that VC command to use a git
  command that does not grab the lock.  #2708, debbug#21559

* Adding an untracked subdirectory as a submodule failed if a remote
  was not configured for the subdirectory repository.  #3047

* Parsing the log buffer failed if the log displayed a ref that
  contained parentheses in its name.  #3028

* Parsing the `git show' and `git log' output for a signed commit
  failed with the Git variable `log.showSignature' enabled.  #3061

* When deleting the current branch, `magit-branch-delete' did not ask
  for confirmation in some cases.  #3058

This release also contains the fixes described in the v2.10.{1,2,3}
release notes, as well as other minor improvements, bug fixes, typo
fixes, and documentation fixes.
