Magit v0.7.0 Release Notes
==========================

Released 8 March 2009 by Marius Vollmer.

Changes since v0.6.1
--------------------

 * Tagging, on 't' and 'T'.

 * Stashing, on 'z' and 'Z'.

 * Wazzup, on 'w'.  Wazzup gives you an overview over how other
   branches relate to the current one.

 * There is more control over pushing.  'P' now takes a prefix argument
   and pushing a branch without a default remote will ask for one.

 * Logs have changed a bit: 'l' shows the traditional brief log, and
   'L' shows a more verbose log.  Use the prefix arg to specify the
   range of the log.

 * M-x magit-status doesn't prompt anymore for a directory when invoked
   from within a Git repository.  Use C-u to force a prompt.

 * When you have nothing staged, 'c' will now explicitly ask whether to
   commit everything instead of just going ahead and do it.  This can
   be customized.

 * The digit keys '1', '2', '3', and '4' now show sections on the
   respective level and hide everything below.  With Meta, they work on
   all sections; without, they work only on sections that are a parent
   or child of the current section.

 * Typing '+' and '-' will change the size of hunks, via the "-U"
   option to git diff.  '0' resets hunks to their default size.

 * Typing 'k' on the "Untracked files" section title will offer to
   delete all untracked files.

 * Magit understands a bit of git-svn: the status buffer shows unpushed
   and unpulled commits, 'N r' runs git svn rebase, and 'N c' runs git
   svn dcommit.

 * Magit now also works when the direcory is accessed via tramp.

 * M-x magit-status can also create new repositories when given a
   directory that is not a Git repository.

 * Magit works better with oldish Gits that don't understand "--graph",
   for example.

 * The name of the Git program and common options for it can be
   customized.
