Magit v2.10.2 Release Notes (unreleased)
========================================

Fixes since v2.10.1
-------------------

* Cherry-picking a commit with multiple parents was not possible,
  because "--mainline" was treated as a switch rather than an option,
  and because of a too-strict assertion that only single-parent commits
  can be cherry-picked.  7a280a0
