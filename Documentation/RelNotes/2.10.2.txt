Magit v2.10.2 Release Notes (unreleased)
========================================

Changes since v2.10.1
---------------------

* The new command `git-rebase-noop' adds a noop action during a
  rebase.  It can be used to make git perform a rebase even if none
  of the commits are selected.  #2991

Fixes since v2.10.1
-------------------

* Cherry-picking a commit with multiple parents was not possible,
  because "--mainline" was treated as a switch rather than an option,
  and because of a too-strict assertion that only single-parent commits
  can be cherry-picked.  #2978

* magit-abbrev-length mishandled two edge cases, returning 0 when
  called within an empty repository or outside of a repository.

* A bug fix in the last release broke the visit-file functionality in
  diff buffers displayed while committing.  #2988

* Diff buffers did not recognize "rev^-n" as a short-hand for
  "rev^n..rev" (new in Git v2.11), resulting in the buffer header
  incorrectly indicating that the diff was between "rev^-n" and the
  working tree.
