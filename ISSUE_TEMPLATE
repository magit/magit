Please use the Emacs StackExchange site [1] or the Gitter chat [2] for support
requests. But before you do that please read the list of frequently asked
questions [3] and consult the manual [4] and a search engine.

We only use this issue tracker for feature requests and for defects.

How to ask for a new feature and other improvements
=================================================================

Before you ask for a new feature to be added to Magit or for an existing feature
to be improved, please make sure that what are asking for does not already exist
by consulting the documentation [5].

Then explain the feature you would like to see in Magit and why that is useful
to you.

=================================================================
How to report defects
=================================================================

Please explain
  (1) what behavior you expected
  (2) what behavior you observed
  (3) and how we can reproduce the issue.

Also post the output of

  M-x magit-version RET

Before reporting a defect please try to reproduce it using an Emacs instance in
which only Magit and its dependencies have been loaded. Other packages or your
configuration should not be loaded. This makes it easier to determine whether
the issue lays with Magit or something else.

If you run Magit from its Git repository, then you can do so using:

  $ cd /path/to/magit
  $ make emacs-Q

Alternatively, run `M-x magit-emacs-Q-command RET` to save a shell command to
the `kill-ring` and the system's clip-board, which you can then copy into a
shell to run.

Finally, if that didn't work and you have installed Magit from Melpa, then run
commands similar to the ones below, but use tab completion to replace the
various Ns with the correct versions:

  $ cd ~/.emacs.d/elpa/magit-N
  $ emacs -Q --debug-init --eval '(setq debug-on-error t)' -L ../dash-N -L ../git-commit-N -L ../magit-popup-N -L ../with-editor-N -L . -l magit

More debugging tools are described in the manual [6].
