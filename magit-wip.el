When `HEAD' is detached then \"HEAD\" is used for both %b and %r.
The use of %r is recommended but %b is used in the default value
for compatibilty with git-wip (https://github.com/bartman/git-wip)."

While this mode can be activated manually it is better to do
so using either

  git config --add magit.extension wip-save

to activate it in individual repositories or

  git config --global --add magit.extension wip-save

effect after _also_ turning on `global-magit-wip-save-mode'."
