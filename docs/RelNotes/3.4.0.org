* Magit v3.4.0 Release Notes (unreleased)
** Breaking changes
** Changes since v3.3.0

- Added new function ~git-commit-turn-on-orglink~ intended for use in
  ~git-commit-setup-hook~.  d122f15edd

- ~git-commit.el~ no longer depends on ~dash~.  bb7b7a4020

7a94132384 Rename magit-keep-region-overlay to magit-section-keep-region-overlay

- Some repository and submodule list columns got a bit fancier.
  3f3980735f 451438dc90

- Refreshing a repository or submodule list buffer now restores the
  previous position.  1feda0cb1c

ceab3124fb magit-submodule-list-predicate: New variable

- Added new face ~git-rebase-action~ to allow customization of the face
  used for the action words in git-rebase-todo files.  #4544

6da7771b61 magit-faces: Add diff-refine-{added,removed}

- When invoked with a prefix argument ~magit-fetch-modules~ now acts as a
  transient prefix command.  fd5b9eadf3

- Added new face ~magit-branch-warning~ and improved related faces.
  bf3bcbe051 ff

dfe3d03a14 git-commit-save-message: Report whether message was saved

- Added new commands ~git-commit-search-message-backward~ and
  ~git-commit-search-message-forward~.  #4537

- Make use of ~with-connection-local-variables~, and for older Emacsen
  use a stripped down implementation. #4568

- Added new functions ~version>~ and ~version=~ using the names
  ~magit-version>~ and ~magit-version=~.  My brain is too small to always
  get yoda conditions right, while the Emacs maintainers have huge
  brains and as a consequence have rejected the addition of these
  functions on grounds of them being unnecessary.  I don't want to
  make such mistakes anymore, so I am forced to define these functions
  myself.  I guess this makes me a Sith.  c8c2efd014

- Added new command ~magit-log-related~.  c33ed664e6

- New transient ~magit-sparse-checkout~ provides an interface to the
  ~git sparse-checkout~ command, introduced in Git v2.25.  #4102

- New command ~magit-clone-sparse~ makes it possible to clone a
  repository and then immediately enable a sparse checkout, avoiding a
  checkout of the full working tree.  #4102

- The ~magit-clone~ transient now includes ~--filter~ (hidden by
  default) to support partial cloning, a feature that is available as
  of Git v2.17.  #4102

- ~magit-clone-url-format~ can now be configured to an alist to
  support servers that employ different URL schemes.  #4738

- Added new command ~magit-stash-push~, which allows specifying a list of
  files to be stashed.  #4583

- Added some forward compatibility for SHA-256.  #4585

429d5c55e8 magit-tag-release: Use version from HEAD's message if appropriate

- Added new face ~magit-section-child-count~.  #4599

- Improved version display and sorting in repository list buffers.
  53199f2dd5, 68be0584f4

- Added support for marking repositories in repository list buffers
  and acting on the marked repositories.  #4453

- Improved internals of the version/feature check caches.  On the user
  visible side, teach ~magit-zap-caches~ to zap everything, when invoked
  with a prefix argument.  #4603

- Rewrote Imenu support, which resulted in a few new features and much
  less code.  4727dcbe22 ff

- For performance reasons the "margin" style sadly had to be removed
  from ~magit-blame-styles~.  608242086e

- When blaming, neighboring chunks about the same commit are now
  combined into just one chunk.  #4030

- Added new command ~magit-git-mergetool~.  #4128

- Taught ~magit-diff-dwim~ about commits of submodules shown in the status
  buffer of the super-repository.  #4151

- A cherry pick or revert can now be continued when there are unstaged
  changes as long as there are no unresolved conflicts, a behavior
  that more closely matches the command line behavior.  #4615

- For the longest time (which is why I don't consider this a bug fix)
  toggling a section caused point to move to the beginning of that
  section.  Stop doing that unless absolutely necessary.  9d8d5e5603

70b34f08ab Increase use of section type, keymap and binding inheritance

- Sections can now be expanded and collapsed by double-clicking on the
  section heading or by clicking on the left margin.  949b4a47a4

- The menu-bar menu, which was severely neglected for many years,
  finally got a makeover.  It no longer offers a completely random
  subset of Magit's features.  Now it can be used to invoke most of
  the commands that could also be invoked using ~magit-dispatch~; but
  by means of a small furry animal.  5641d3749c

- Added many context menus, which can be invoked using the mouse or
  a key (~menu~ by default) and are a great way to discover context
  sensitive commands.  Unfortunately this isn't enabled by default.
  In Emacs 28 and greater, the new global mode ~context-menu-mode~ has
  to be enabled.  Set ~magit-section-show-context-menu-for-emacs<28~
  to ~t~ if you are still using an older release.  #4645

0bbf31a2ef magit--git-variable:choices: Support fallback instead of default

- Depend on the Compat package, allowing me to use convenient features
  that were added to Emacs over the last few years, without having to
  wait another few years until everybody has updated to a reasonably
  recent Emacs release.  571b4346c1

- Added new option ~magit-openpgp-default-signing-key~.  4eed9e1a45

- Added new command ~magit-toggle-git-debug~.  2ed5a06d08

- Tag messages and signatures are now turned into sections in commit
  buffers.  476383fc8f

- Work has began on making internal circular dependencies a thing of
  the past.

- The help text displayed in ~git-rebase-mode~ buffers got a makeover.
  670dad14b5 ff

- Added new command ~magit-ediff-resolve-all~, an alternative to
  ~magit-ediff-resolve-rest~ (formerly known as ~magit-ediff-resolve~).
  The new option ~magit-ediff-dwim-resolve-function~ controls which
  is used by ~magit-ediff-dwim~ (the new command ~magit-git-mergetool~
  is another option).  #4348

- Improve the diff shown while committing.  #3246

[TODO Keep these at end.]

- Added new infix arguments and suffixes to the transient prefix
  commands ~magit-pull~, ~magit-rebase~ and ~magit-dispatch~.  Likewise
  added new commands to keymaps ~magit-stashes-section-map~.  [TODO more]
