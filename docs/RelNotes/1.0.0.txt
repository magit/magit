Magit v1.0.0 Release Notes
==========================

Released 23 March 2011 by Phil Jackson.

Changes since v0.8.2
--------------------

 * New library `magit-key-mode.el'.  From a popup buffer dispatch
   Magit/Emacs commands which wrap Git commands and select the
   arguments passed to Git.  Group various sets of related commands
   in new menus and adjust them accordingly.

 * New library `magit-svn.el' based on code previously in `magit.el'.
   Improve the implementation.  Control `git svn' from Magit.

 * New library `magit-topgit.el' based on code previously in
   `magit.el'.  Improve the implementation.  Control TopGit from Magit.

 * Provide a wrapper for `completing-read'.  Support using iswitchb to
   do completion.

 * Fixed and improved information shown during a rebase.

 * New macro `magit-define-inserter' to define functions which insert
   sections.

 * New macro `magit-add-action'.  A hook-like extension mechanism for
   commands that behave differently based on the type of the section
   at point.

 * New macro `magit-define-command'.  Like `defun' but also define
   a hook in addition to the function/command.  If a hook function
   succeeds do not run the function body as passed to this macro.

   and `magit-add-change-log-entry-other-window'.
