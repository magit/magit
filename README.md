It's Magit!  An Emacs mode for Git
==================================

Magit is an interface to [Git][git] for [Emacs][emacs].

Unlike Emacs's native [version control support][vc] which strives to
provide a unified interface to various version control systems, Magit
only supports Git and can therefor take full advantage of its native
features.

Magit supports GNU Emacs 22.1 or later; 24.1 or later is recommended.

Getting Started
===============

To get started with Magit, run <kbd>M-x magit-status</kbd>.  If you
are inside a Git repository this opens a buffer that summarizes its
status.  Otherwise you are first prompted for a repository.  Read the
short help for `magit-mode` (<kbd>C-h m</kbd> in the status buffer),
make some changes to your files, stage (<kbd>s</kbd>), and commit
(<kbd>c</kbd>) them.

For more details consult the Magit user manual.  You can read it
[on the web][manual] or in Emacs with <kbd>C-u C-h i magit.info</kbd>.

Magit also has a [website][website].

Installation
============

Emacs >=24.1 includes a facility that lets you easily download and
install packages.  Using `package.el` is the easiest and recommended
way to install Magit and its dependencies.  If you don't want use it
see the extended installation instructions in INSTALL.md
([weblink][installing]).

The stable Magit version is available from the [Marmalade][marmalade]
package repository.  If you want to install the development version
(the `master` branch) use the [Melpa][melpa] repository instead.
Please note that *all* packages on Melpa are built from the upstream
`master` branch.  If you generally want stable versions but the latest
Magit use Marmalade and install Magit from Git.

First tell `package.el` to use one of the package repository:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
```

**or**

```lisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/") t)
```

For details please see the website of the package repository of your
choosing.

Then install Magit (and its run-time dependencies):

<kbd>M-x install-package RET magit RET</kbd>

Development

Magit's canonical source repository is
[hosted on Github][development].
