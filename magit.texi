@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

With Magit, you can inspect and modify any number of Git repositories.
You can review and commit the changes you have made to the tracked
files, for example, and you can browse the history of past changes.

Magit is not a complete interface to Git, it just makes the most
common Git command-line tools more convenient to use.  Thus, while
Magit is a good way to experiment with Git, it will not save you from
learning Git itself.

This manual provides a tour of all Magit features.  It does not give a
introduction to version control in general, or to Git in particular.

The main entry point to Magit is @kbd{M-x magit-status}, which will
put you in Magit's status buffer.  You will be using it frequently, so
it is probably a good idea to bind @code{magit-status} to a key of
your choice.

In addition to the status buffer, Magit will also create buffers that
show lists of commits, buffers with diffs, and other kinds of buffers.
All these buffers are in @code{magit-mode} and have the same key
bindings.  Not all commands make sense in all contexts, but a given
key will always do the same thing.

@node Acknowledgments
@chapter Acknowledgments

From day one of the first Magit announcement, John Wiegley, Linh Dang,
and Christian Neukirchen have contributed fixes, UI improvements, and
new features.  Thanks!

@node Status
@chapter Status

Running @kbd{M-x magit-status} displays the main interface of Magit,
the status buffer.

You can have multiple status buffers active at the same time, each
associated with its own Git repository.  Running @code{magit-status}
in a buffer will display the status buffer for the repository that
contains the file in that buffer.  Running @code{magit-status} outside
of any Git repository or when giving it a prefix argument will ask you
for the directory to run it in.

You need to explicitly refresh the status buffer when you have made
changes to the repository from outside of Emacs.  You can type @kbd{g}
in the status buffer itself, or just use @kbd{M-x magit-status}
instead of @kbd{C-x b} when switching to it.  You also need to refresh
the status buffer in this way after saving a file in Emacs.

The header at the top of the status buffer shows a short summary of
the repository state: where it is located, which branch is checked
out, etc.  Below the header are up to four sections that show details
about the working tree and the staging area.  Only sections that are
not empty are shown.

The first of these sections lists @emph{Untracked files}.  These are
the files that are present in your working tree but are not known to
Git; they are neither tracked in the current branch nor explicitly
ignored.  You can move point to one of the listed files and type
@kbd{s} to add it to the staging area.  Or you can tell Git to ignore
the file by typing @kbd{i}.

Magit has no shortcuts for removing or renaming files.  You need to
use @code{git rm} or @code{git mv} in a shell and then refresh the
status buffer.

The next section, named @emph{Unstaged changes}, shows the differences
between the working tree and the staging area.  Thus, it shows the
modifications that have not been staged yet and would thus not be
included if you would commit now.

The next section, @emph{Staged changes}, shows the differences between
the staging area and the current head.  These are the changes that
would be included if you would commit now.

Unlike other version control interfaces, Magit does not usually
operate on files: Instead of dealing with files (or sets of files),
differences are shown as diffs and you deal with the individual hunks.

Normally, you will prepare the staging area so that it contains
changes that you want to commit as a unit.  You can leave changes that
you are not yet ready to commit safely out of the staging area.

To move a hunk from the working tree into the staging area, move point
into the hunk and type @kbd{s}.  Likewise, to unstage a hunk, move
point into it and type @kbd{u}.  If point is in a diff header when you
type @kbd{s} or @kbd{u}, all hunks belonging to that diff are moved at
the same time.  To move all hunks of all diffs into the staging area
in one go, type @kbd{S}.

Before committing the changes in the staging area, you should write a
short description of them.

Type @kbd{c} to pop up a buffer where you can write your change
description.  Once you are happy with the description, type @kbd{C-c
C-c} in that buffer to commit the staged changes.

Typing @kbd{C} will also pop up the change description buffer, but in
addition, it will try to insert a ChangeLog-style entry for the change
that point is in.

If the current branch is associated with a remote repository, the
status buffer will show a fourth section, named @emph{Unpushed
commits}.  It will briefly list the commits that you have made in your
local repository, but have not yet pushed.  See @ref{Pushing and
Pulling} for more information.

@node History
@chapter History

To show the repository history of your current head, type @kbd{l}.  A
new buffer will be shown that displays the history in a terse form.
The first paragraph of each commit message is displayed, next to a
representation of the relationships between commits.

Typing @kbd{L} will ask for the starting and end point of the history.
This can be used to show the commits that are in one branch, but not
in another, for example.

You can move point to a commit and then cause various things to happen
with it.  (The following commands work in any list of commit, such as
the one shown in the @emph{Unpushed commits} section.)

Typing @kbd{RET} will pop up more information about the current
commit.

Typing @kbd{a} will apply the current commit to your working tree and
staging area.  This is useful when you are browsing the history of
some other branch and you want to `cherry-pick' some changes from it
for your current branch.  A typical situation is applying selected bug
fixes from the development version of a program to a release branch.

Typing @kbd{v} will revert the current commit.  Thus, it will apply
the changes made by that commit in reverse.  This is obviously useful
to cleanly undo changes that turned out to be wrong.

Typing @kbd{=} will show the differences from the current commit to
the @dfn{marked} commit.

You can mark the current commit by typing @kbd{.}.  Some commands,
such as @kbd{=}, will use the current commit and the marked commit as
implicit arguments.  Other commands will offer the marked commit as a
default when prompting for their arguments.

@node Diffing
@chapter Diffing

To show the changes from you working tree to another revision, type
@kbd{d}.  To show the changes between two arbitrary revisions, type
@kbd{D}.

@node Resetting
@chapter Resetting

Once you have added a commit to your local repository, you can not
change that commit anymore in any way.  But you can reset your current
head to an earlier commit and start over.

If you have published your history already, rewriting it in this way
can be confusing and should be avoided.  However, rewriting your local
history is fine and it is often cleaner to fix mistakes this way than
by reverting commits (with @kbd{R}, for example).

Typing @kbd{x} will ask for a revision and reset your current head to
it.  No changes will be made to your working tree and staging area.
Thus, the @emph{Staged changes} section in the status buffer will show
the changes that you have removed from your commit history.  You can
commit the changes again as if you had just made them, thus rewriting
history.

Typing @kbd{x} while point is in a line that describes a commit will
offer this commit as the default revision to reset to.  Thus, you can
move point to one of the commits in the @emph{Unpushed commits}
section and hit @kbd{x RET} to reset your current head to it.

Type @kbd{X} to reset your working tree and staging area to the most
recently committed state.  This will discard your local modifications,
so be careful.

@node Branching
@chapter Branching

The current branch is indicated in the header of the status buffer.
You can switch to a different branch by typing @kbd{b}.  This will
immediately checkout the branch into your working copy, so you
shouldn't have any local modifications when switching branches.

Similar to @kbd{x}, typing @kbd{b} while point is at a commit
description will offer that commit as the default to switch to.
This will result in a detached head.

To create a new branch and switch to it immediately, type @kbd{B}.

@node Merging
@chapter Merging

Magit offers two ways to merge branches: manually and automatic.  A
manual merge will apply all changes to your working tree and staging
area, but will not commit them, while a automatic merge will go ahead
and commit them immediately.

Type @kbd{m} to initiate a manual merge, and type @kbd{M} for a
automatic merge.

A manual merge is useful when carefully merging a new feature that you
want to review and test before even committing it.  A automatic merge
is appropriate when you are on a feature branch and want to catch up
with the master, say.

After initiating a manual merge, the header of the status buffer will
remind you that the next commit will be a merge commit (with more than
one parent).  If you want to abort a manual merge, just do a hard
reset to HEAD.

Merges can fail if the two branches you merge want to introduce
conflicting changes.  In that case, the automatic merge stops before
the commit, essentially falling back to a manual merge.  You need to
resolve the conflicts and stage the resolved files, for example with
@kbd{S}.

You can not stage individual hunks one by one as you resolve them, you
can only stage whole files once all conflicts in them have been
resolved.

@node Rebasing
@chapter Rebasing

Typing @kbd{R} in the status buffer will initiate a rebase or, if one
is already in progress, ask you how to continue.

When a rebase is stopped in the middle because of a conflict, the
header of the status buffer will indicate how far along you are in the
series of commits that are being replayed.

Of course, you can initiate a rebase in any number of ways, by
configuring @code{git pull} to rebase instead of merge, for example.
Such a rebase can be finished with @kbd{R} as well.

@node Pushing and Pulling
@chapter Pushing and Pulling

Magit will run @code{git pull} when you type @kbd{U} in the status
buffer, and it will run @code{git push} when you type @kbd{P}.  You
can type @kbd{$} to pop up a buffer with the transcript of running
these commands.

That's almost all the support for remote repositories that Magit
offers.  You should have setup your Git configuration to do the right
thing for @code{git push} and @code{git pull}.

If you have configured a default remote repository for the current
branch (by setting the Git config option
@code{branch.<branch>.remote}), Magit will show that repository in the
status buffer header.

In this case, the status buffer will also have a @emph{Unpushed
commits} section that shows the commits on you current head that are
not in the branch named @code{<remote>/<branch>}.  This section works
much like the history buffer: you can see details about a commit with
@kbd{RET}, and compare two of them with @kbd{.} and @kbd{=}.

@bye
