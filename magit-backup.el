;;; Commentary:

;; This library implements support for creating stashes that serve
;; as backups.  When `magit-backup-mode' is enabled, then many Magit
;; command that may lose data, try to mitigate the risk by first
;; saving a stash to `magit-backup-ref'.

;; Note that "many" is not the same as "all" and that "Magit" is not
;; the same as "any way in which one can interact with a repository".
;; Generally speaking only changes which can be saved by creating a
;; stash, are being saved by creating a stash - which is exactly the
;; sort of tautology you would in the description of any backup tool.

;; You might also be interested in `magit-wip-save-mode', which is
;; defined elsewhere, and which covers one of the many cases where
;; using `magit-backup-mode' would not have saved you.
