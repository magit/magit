Before you ask for a new feature to be added to Magit or for an existing feature to be improved, please make sure that what are asking for does not already exist by consulting the documentation [1].

Then describe the feature you would like to see in Magit and why it would be useful to you.  You might also want to describe any alternative solutions or features you've considered.
